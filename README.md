## üõ†Ô∏è Known Gaps

- **Authentication**: No user login/signup; uses a fixed demo user.
- **Image Upload**: Feedback only supports image URLs, not direct file uploads.
- **Persistence**: Uses in-memory or localStorage for demo; not production-grade database.
- **Scalability**: Not optimized for high concurrent users.
- **Mobile Experience**: Responsive, but not fully optimized for all mobile devices.
- **Community Features**: No peer-to-peer or group learning yet.
- **Moderation**: Basic content safety, no advanced moderation tools.
